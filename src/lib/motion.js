/**
 * Shared motion system

 * Single source of truth for animation timing, easing, and reusable variant
 * presets. Components import from here instead of hardcoding durations, delays,
 * and easing inline.
 *
 * Duration tiers are derived from the values already dominant in the codebase:
 *   - fast (0.2): quick UI feedback (taps, small toggles)
 *   - base (0.5): standard content reveals
 *   - slow (0.8): hero / ceremonial moments
 *
 * Reduced motion: use `useMotionPreset` / `useReducedMotionFlag` so that, when
 * the user requests reduced motion, positional and scale movement collapse to
 * opacity-only (or instant), and decorative loops can be suppressed.
